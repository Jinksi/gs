### Our priority is providing your child with a safe, clean and nurturing environment. If your child has fallen ill, for the interest of you, your child, and other children in the centre we ask that they should be picked up immediately.

If a child becomes unwell whilst at the centre the parents or care givers will be notified and asked to take the child home. Unwell children must be collected from the centre within an hour of being contacted therefore families must ensure emergency contacts are documented as part of the enrolment process and are available.

We may need to call an ambulance or doctor if urgent medical attention is required. Every effort will be made to contact the parent or their nominated emergency contact as soon as possible.

All medical and ambulance costs are the parentâ€™s responsibility. All illness at the centre is recorded on an Incident, Injury, Trauma, and Illness Record form.

**You will find a table below detailing some common childhood illnesses and the exclusion periods recommended by the National Health and Medical Research Council that we follow. You can find the full publication this table is taken from in Staying Healthy in Childcare, 5th edition at [www.nhmrc.gov.au](https://www.nhmrc.gov.au).**
