## Role of Teachers and Educators

1. Be a co-learner

In the Reggio approach, the Educator is considered a co-learner and collaborator with the child and not just an instructor. Educators are encouraged to facilitate the child's learning by planning experiences and lessons based on the child's interests, asking questions to further understanding and actively engaging in the activities alongside the child.



2. Engage children in play

Our dedicated Teachers and Educators recognise pedagogy that actively engages children in play as one of the main ways in which children learn and develop. They use a holistic approach when planning for the whole child’s development. They pay attention to the children’s physical, personal, social, emotional and wellbeing as well as cognitive aspects of their learning.



3. Contributing to learning

Our Educators are invaluable; their personalities and beliefs contribute to making a successful learning environment. They have a range of early childhood teaching qualifications including Bachelor of Early Childhood, Advanced Diploma in Early Childhood, Diploma in Early Childhood or a Certificate 3 in Early Childhood.



4. Protecting and caring

We ensure that working with children checks are carried out on all Educators before they are employed and all employees follow the ethical code of conduct. Educators are aware of their obligations with regard to child protection and mandatory reporting and follow the services child protection policy and regulations.



5. Educational leader

We have a Head Educational Leader to support the Educators with education programming and the implementation of the Reggio Emilia Approach. In each of the classroom there is an Educator Leader. The Educator Leader is the room leader and is responsible for preparing the educational program and curriculum. Our Head Educational Leader and Educational Leaders devise strategies to ensure the ongoing development of the educators thereby creating the best possible learning environments. All educators in classroom are involved in preparing and participating in the educational programs using our online curriculum software - Qk Journeys.

Educational Leaders are allocated child-free time each week to plan curriculum and plan and evaluate each child’s learning. This time is essential for the delivery of a high-quality curriculum.

Additional Assistant Educators may work at the Centre when children with additional needs attend (additional government funding is required to be approved for the appointment of additional educators).

Please read Educator profile to provide you with background information and an outline of their qualifications and experience.
