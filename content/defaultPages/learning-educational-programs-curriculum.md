      Young children need lots of love and extra special care. Our dedicated
      infant room is a comfortable place filled with nurturing surroundings and
      loving care. 


      We provide wonderful sensorial experiences through our stimulating rich
      environments which are full of textures, light, creativity and age
      appropriate resources. This enables our babies to develop independence as
      they can freely explore their creativity with a vast range of quality
      resources and experiences to stimulate and inspire their young developing
      minds.


      Our program offers each child one-on-one and group activities, gentle play
      and safe exploration. It’s stimulating to the development of young minds
      without being overwhelming.


      Each infants’ needs are different, so we have flexible routines for
      babies. There are areas for sleep, relaxing and personal space and the
      opportunity for outdoor experiences in the fresh air. And so that you
      don’t miss out on all those little things that happen each day, your child
      has their own personal online learning portfolio in QKeYLM that captures
      their journey as it unfolds.

      For a toddler the world is a magical place, full of constant learning and
      exploration. When caring for toddlers we help facilitate that adventure
      along with positive emotional guidance helping them to understand the
      boundaries of their independence.


      Our educations in the toddler classrooms will acknowledge individuality
      and all areas of development. Furthermore, our educators will scaffold all
      children’s learning by taking them step by step through new skills with
      enough support to ensure their success.


      We help provide structure through a consistent routine which includes free
      play, structured play, group times for music and language, and outdoor
      experiences. Our encouraging and nurturing educators are sensitive to the
      individual needs of each toddler’s social and emotional development. And
      each child has their own personal online learning portfolio in QKeYLM
      which helps you follow them on their exciting journey of self-discovery.

      As 3-year old’s start coming into their own, it’s important they have time
      and space to explore their independence in a safe and supportive
      environment.


      In our 3-year-old educational programs we help develop autonomy and an
      openness to learning. We encourage respectfulness and nurture social
      development skills. Our structured yet flexible educational programs
      provide lots of opportunities for individual and group learning in
      language, music, communications and problem-solving skills. And because
      3-year old’s also have so much energy to burn, our exciting outdoor play
      areas offer plenty of room for active play. Your child will also have
      their own personal online learning portfolio so you can see what they’ve
      been up to each day.

      Our approved kindergarten program, with a bachelor qualified teacher,
      offers a secure and encouraging environment for children to develop
      autonomy, focus on respectful relationships and understand social
      courtesies. We engage children with individual, small group and whole
      group experiences and structured group sessions for discussion times,
      music and language. All activities are designed to be flexible and are
      focused on the learning experience rather than the academic outcome, while
      literacy and numeracy is introduced naturally through everyday
      experiences.


      Learning projects are implemented to extend child development. The project
      extends from children’s enquiries where studies of concepts, ideas and
      interests are fulfilled. These projects are considered a journey. Our
      educators scaffold learning, help make decisions about the direction of
      study, the ways in which groups research the topic and the selection of
      materials needed.


      Our 4-year-old kindergarten program is aimed at preparing children for
      school. We focus on helping children understand and deal with their
      emotions, to be able to initiate friendships and develop self-confidence
      and self-esteem. We know that social and emotional readiness will assist
      in successful entry to school, allowing them to be effective learners. You
      will be able see your child’s learning and development progress in their
      own personal online learning portfolio and see what they’ve been up to
      each day. 


      Children who are enrolled in our kindergarten program will have a School
      Transition Statement prepared and provided to their school. The statement
      provides information about your child learning and development to give
      them the head start for their primary schooling.

### We understand the importance of education and believe that childhood is a unique time of life which should be valued and enjoyed.

We recognise that early childhood is a time when foundations are laid for future health, learning and wellbeing. We use a Reggio Emilia approach to achieve the objectives outlined in the National and Victorian Early Years Learning and Development Frameworks to enhance each child’s emotional and developmental competence in the following ways:

###### Our curriculum supports:

* Emotional: Self-awareness, Self-control and Self-regulation
* Social: Cooperation, Sharing, Turn-taking, Problem solving
* Physical (fine motor): Small muscle development (cutting, drawing)
* Physical (gross motor): Large muscle development (running, jumping)
* Cognitive: Thinking, Listening, Resolving Conflict and concentration
* Language: Communications, Self-expression, and Self-expression.
