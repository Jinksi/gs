    ### Great Start Early Learning Centres is registered as a provider of
    “Approved Care” under the Child Care System (“CCS”). Under CCS, the Federal
    Government provides us with each family’s approval details directly, which
    is why each family must be registered with Centrelink.


    The Australian Government may provide financial assistance towards the cost
    of childcare. If you would like to access this assistance, please include
    this information in your child’s enrolment form:


    * Your Customer Reference Number (CRN – issued to you by the Family
    Assistance Office).

    * Your child’s Customer Reference Number (issued to you by the Family
    Assistance Office)

    * Your date of birth (CRN Holder).

    * Your child’s date of birth.


    ###### **This information will be provided to the Australian Government and
    validated against their records to determine if you can receive fee
    subsidies. Your subsidy will then be subtracted from the full fees owing,
    leaving a gap fee which is the amount families pay to the Centre, meaning
    less out of pocket expense.**

enrolmentsSection3: "We also require you to register at myGov at https://my.gov.au. MyGov is a simple and secure government online service providing information on:\n\n* Australian Taxation Office\n* Centrelink\n* Child Support\n* Medicare\n* My Health Record\n\n**From the 1 July 2018, you will be required to authorise your child’s attendance using the MyGov or telephoning the government agency.**\n\nNote: Even if you have previously registered with Centrelink for another childcare centre you will still need to contact the Centrelink again to provide the specific details of your child’s enrolment. This can be completed via your myGov account. You may also need to provide updated financial information.\n\n### All fees are to be paid in accordance with the Terms and Conditions of Enrolment, Fee Schedule and our Fee Policy.\n\nThe following information is general information regarding payment of centre fees.\n\n* Your child’s attendance is booked and charged on a daily basis (not a part day basis).\n* An\_initial booking fee is due when your position is confirmed to secure your child’s enrolment. The initial fee is non-refundable if your child does not attend as booked.\n* Two weeks advance payment (current week plus 2 weeks) of full fees is required before your child starts and must be maintained during your child’s attendance.\n* Fees will apply for booked days that your child does not attend due to illness, holidays or public holidays.\n* We provide Statements weekly via email and these can also be requested at any time from your Centre Director at the administration office.\n* Late Pick-up Fees: We understand that sometimes families may run late and collect their child after our early learning program ends. Please see our fee schedule for additional costs of continuing to provide care after the operating hours. This will be charged to your account accordingly. If late pick-up occurs regularly the centre reserves the right to cancel child’s enrolment.\n* If your account falls in arrears, your Centre Director will work with you to plan your payments to bring your account back to two weeks in advance. Failure to comply with the terms and conditions of enrolment may result in child’s enrolment being terminated.\n* If your account is referred to our debt collectors, recovery costs of 25% of the outstanding account balance will be added to your account.\n* If an account goes into credit due to the application or backdating of CCB or CCS entitlement, that credit will remain on the customer’s account to be set against subsequent fee statements. If an account is in credit when a child leaves the Centre, after all fees owing have been paid, then the source of the balance will be reviewed to determine whether the money should be returned to the parent or refunded to the Federal Government as an overpayment of Child Care Subsidy.\n\nOur method of payment is via direct debit either from your nominated bank account or credit card. Once your completed direct debit form has been received at the centre your fees will be debited and automatically applied to your childcare account.\n\nDishonour fees are charged to you by the financial institutions. The charge is set by the financial institution or agency and is subject to change at any time. For further information consult the financial institution website.\n\nIf cash or cheque payments are made, they should be handed to the Centre Director and a cash receipt will be issued. No responsibility will be accepted by the centre for cash payments for which parents have not obtained a receipt. Cheque payments should be made payable to Great Start Early Learning Centres Pty Ltd. The Centre Director or Educator will assist you with EFTPOS payments. The details for BPay are listed on your weekly account statement."

      Like most early learning centres, your child’s place is reserved when they
      are away so the day still needs to be paid for. Each financial year, the
      Family Assistance Office will pay your childcare subsidies for the first
      42 absence days. These absences can be for any reason, including public
      holidays, and the initial 42 days must be used before any additional
      absences can be claimed (please see below).


      You may receive child care subsidies for absence days after the initial 42
      days each financial year if you are able to provide evidence to
      demonstrate the absence has occurred under permitted circumstances. There
      is no limit on these days, but you will be required to provide
      documentation to support the absence. Please see the Governments website
      for more information.
    title: Entitlement When Your Child is Absent

      To secure child’s enrolment, an initial fee of two weeks fees is required
      to be paid on enrolment of your child or $100 (whichever is greater). The
      initial fee is not refundable under any circumstances; I.e. if you child
      does not attend the centre as booked, you cancel your child enrolment
      before commencement, etc. 


      Once your child commences at the centres, the amount equal to the initial
      fee will be credited to your account and offset against the attendance
      fees charged.
    title: Initial Fees to Secure Enrolment

      Families taking annual leave will be entitled to a holiday discount in
      accordance with the fee schedule of the centre, provided two weeks notice
      in writing is given of intended dates of absence. Holiday discounts will
      only apply to a whole week of holidays taken at a time. Any holidays taken
      as part weeks or single days will not attract a discount. Discounts will
      only be applied to parent accounts that are up to date and where
      appropriate written notice has been given.

      Should a public holiday fall on a booked day, families may request to swap
      the day (subject to notified availability) in the week of the public
      holiday. Please note child care subsidies are usually paid for public
      holidays, unless your initial 42 days have already been used.
