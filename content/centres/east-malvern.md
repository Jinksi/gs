      #### Outdoor

      Our outdoor play space stimulates children's imagination, creativity,
      exploration, discovery, engagement and a sense of wonder. We have created

      materials and magical play spaces. We have carefully designed and planned
      spaces to encourage a stronger understanding of the environment and
      sustainability – while giving children the scope to explore, play and let
      their imaginations roam.

    **Liz Cosier – Centre Director**


    I am very passionate about the Reggio Emilia Approach. We tailor our
    curriculum to nurture a child’s intellectual growth and creativity, and lay
    down strong foundations which are so vital in the early years. Our
    curriculum is designed to build upon the children’s interests and to develop
    their skills. Our programming format is unique and is designed to address
    key learning areas including social skills, language, numeracy,
    investigation, creative pursuits, fine and gross motor skills, sensory
    experiences, cultural experiences and environmental understanding. In
    addition to this it addresses the Outcomes as outlined in the Early Years
    Learning Frameworks.


    I believe that each child is unique and learns and explores in his or her
    own way. Therefore, we encourage building on their own interests and
    strengths through scaffolding, mentoring and facilitating their learning and
    development. I believe that our centre truly captivates this and we ignite
    the endless possibilities of learning by embracing challenges and rejoicing
    in accomplishments through our various spaces, open-ended resources and our
    vibrant atmosphere. 


    The team I am fortunate to work with shares my passion for seeing children
    meet their potential. They are dedicated, professional, experienced and
    highly qualified.


    We invite you to come and visit our centre to meet our team and to see for
    yourself our commitment to your child’s early learning journey.
