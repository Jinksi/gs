  East Malvern Early Learning Centre is a beautiful cottage with lots of charm
    and character. We are in the Malvern East community, close to buses and
    Darlington Train Station

We only have a maximum of 50 children attending the centre each day across four classrooms; this provides opportunities for educators, parents and children to develop close relationships. We offer care to all age groups from as young as six weeks up to school age. We are open every day from Monday to Friday, except for public holidays.

We pride ourselves on having the best curriculum and education programs which is supported by having experienced and knowledgeable early childhood professional educators. We offer an Approved Kindergarten Program delivered by a teacher with a bachelor’s degree. We have received the highest rating and recognition for our Educational Programs – Exceeding NQS in all seven quality areas. 

We understand the importance of education and believe that childhood is a unique time of life which should be valued and enjoyed. We recognise that early childhood is a time when foundations are laid for future health, learning and wellbeing. We use a Reggio Emilia inspired approach to meet the objectives outlined in the National and Victorian Early Years Learning and Development Frameworks; including emphasis on literacy, numeracy, music and movement and social development.

At East Malvern Early Learning Centre, we provide an environment where both children and families feel safe, secure and supported. A place where partnerships and friendships can be formed and maintained, where trust and credibility can be built upon and upheld, and lines of communication are always open and valued.
