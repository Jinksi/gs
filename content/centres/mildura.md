      #### Centre


      At Mildura Early Learning Centre, we provide an environment where both
      children and families feel safe, secure and supported. A place where
      partnerships and friendships can be formed and maintained, where trust and
      credibility can be built upon and upheld, and lines of communication are
      always open and valued.

      #### Outdoor

      Our inspired outdoor play spaces stimulate children's imagination,
      creativity, exploration, discovery, engagement and a sense of wonder. We
      have created sensory gardens, mud kitchens, herb and vegetable gardens,
      natural materials, a river creek bed, loose parts play and magical play
      spaces. We have carefully designed and planned spaces to encourage a
      stronger understanding of the environment and sustainability – while
      giving children the scope to explore, play and let their imaginations
      roam.

      A major focus for our centre is how working with the broader community can
      help us enrich the children’s learning experience. Through visits to the
      centre as well as excursions and participation in community events, we are
      able to deepen the relationship between the centre and the community,
      while teaching the children about being a contributing and active member
      of society.


      We invite you to come and take a look at our fabulous early learning
      centre and see why we are rated ‘Exceeding’ the National Quality
      Standards.

directorStatement:
  content: >-
    I hold an Advanced Diploma of Early Childhood and I have been in the early
    childhood profession for the past 13 years. I am extremely passionate about
    early childhood education working as a Qualified Educator, Educational
    Leader and Centre Director.


    Having worked with all age groups and having been involved in all aspects of
    child development, I believe that childhood is a special time of life and
    that the first five years are so very important not only for the child but
    also for the family. It is a privilege to be a part of a child’s fundamental
    growth and development and I’m sure that you would agree that there is
    something very rewarding in seeing children reach their true potential
    during this formative and important period of time.


    I look forward to meeting and working with you and your family within our
    centre community.
