      #### Centre


      At Mildura Early Learning Centre, we provide an environment where both
      children and families feel safe, secure and supported. A place where
      partnerships and friendships can be formed and maintained, where trust and
      credibility can be built upon and upheld, and lines of communication are
      always open and valued.

      #### Outdoor

      Our inspired outdoor play spaces stimulate children's imagination,
      creativity, exploration, discovery, engagement and a sense of wonder. We
      have created sensory gardens, mud kitchens, herb and vegetable gardens,
      natural materials, a river creek bed, loose parts play and magical play
      spaces. We have carefully designed and planned spaces to encourage a
      stronger understanding of the environment and sustainability – while
      giving children the scope to explore, play and let their imaginations
      roam.

      A major focus for our centre is how working with the broader community can
      help us enrich the children’s learning experience. Through visits to the
      centre as well as excursions and participation in community events, we are
      able to deepen the relationship between the centre and the community,
      while teaching the children about being a contributing and active member
      of society.


      We invite you to come and take a look at our fabulous early learning
      centre and see why we are rated ‘Exceeding’ the National Quality
      Standards.

    **Megan Gooding – Centre Director**


    I am very passionate about the Reggio Emilia Approach. We tailor our
    curriculum to encourage learning and lay down strong foundations which are
    so vital in the early years. Our curriculum is designed to address the
    children’s interests and to develop their skills. Our programming format is
    unique and is designed to address key learning areas including social
    skills, language, maths, investigation, creative pursuits, fine and gross
    motor skills, sensory experiences, cultural experiences and environmental
    understanding. In addition to this it addresses the Outcomes as outlined in
    the Early Years Learning Frameworks.


    I believe that each child is unique and learns and explores in his or her
    own way. Therefore, we encourage building on their own interests and
    strengths through scaffolding, mentoring and facilitating their learning and
    development. I believe that our centre truly captivates this and we ignite
    the endless possibilities of learning by embracing challenges and rejoicing
    in accomplishments through our various spaces, open-ended resources and our
    vibrant atmosphere. 


    The team I am fortunate to work with shares my passion for seeing children
    meet their potential. They are dedicated, professional, experienced and
    highly qualified.


    We invite you to come and visit our centre to meet our team and to see for
    yourself our commitment to your child’s early learning journey.
